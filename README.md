			   PROJECT KAERU THEME PACK
			   
This pack is for users who wish to create themes for Project Kaeru.

## Rules
- No copyrighted material
- SFW themes only
- No trademarks, branding, etc (I.E. a Wii theme is fine but a theme for *Wiimmfi* is too specific)
- No swearing or similar; make it so any ages can see

## Usage:
- Edit style.css to your liking
- Edit theme.json to be correct (include your FSID; if it's a group project, the FSID is the person who receives the coins) - ensure colour is the same as the one in 'kwbutton.button'
- Edit images to your liking
- ZIP it up and send to a developer.


If accepted, you will be given an email with a certificate, with your UUID, the theme, etc.
